# Youwe ï¼šLegend of Destiny Rebels
 ### A fantasy story about Youwe - a young man and his fellow fight against the unknown and what to find out the answer of the ultimate question - meaning of life

## There is a hypothesis left for you to think:

```
  What if a sheep suddenly become smart, known the truth that his fellow's destiny is to be the food
  switch  what to do : 
    case 1 : Just ignore it, follow the old route; 
    case 2 : tell the truth to other sheep , which may scare them , 
    case 3 : maybe every sheep just know it, they just adapted the style
    case ...
```
I just confused why there always exist fierce competition or war between humans. Why there're so many people struggle in life. Maybe just some 'god' do not want us to have time think about them or fight against them. 

 > At Biology class , my teacher once told us, we are just fuel for Microorganisms. When I'm young, I cant understand it. But think my whole life, I cant leave without them, and finally decomposed by them, they're every where, so small, are they the hand of keepers? Are they make us fight/hate/unjust/impulse ? I do not want it to be a excuse for doing something wrong. Just hope, we can stand together, love each other, no war, no struggle for living, just fight against the unknown not ADAPT or FOLLOW

 >Based on a novel I once write about 10 years ago, with time going on, my thought changes.

 >And I wondering, why not write a novel with a version control tool, so I can track the changes and maybe review the changes many years after - Hah

 >By the way, I need to practice my english writing skill, to prepare for future test or something, my score at writing part always pull my total score down at CET test or others - LOL


 Just have fun for me and you.
